## TCP

TCP is used for organizing data in a way that ensures the secure transmission between the server and client. It guarantees the integrity of data sent over the network, regardless of the amount. For this reason, it is used to transmit data from other higher-level protocols that require all transmitted data to arrive

### Layers of the TCP/IP Model
Unlike the OSI model which comprises seven layers, the TCP/IP model is structured with four different layers. These four layers are:

### 1.	Network Access Layer

-	This is the bottom-most layer of the TCP/IP model architecture

-	It is a combination of the Data Link and Physical Layer of the OSI model

-	The physical transmission of data takes place at this layer

-	Once the frames are transmitted by a network, encapsulating the IP datagram into these frames is done in this layer

-	Also, the mapping of IP address into physical address is done here

-	Mainly, the function of this layer is to transmit the data between two devices, connected in a network

### 2.	Internet Layer

-	It is the second layer of the TCP/IP model and this layer is parallel to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, in terms of the structure
-	Sending the data packets to their destination network is the main function of the Internet layer
-	The logical transmission of data takes place at this level

-	**IP**: One of the most important protocols as it detects the IP address of a device which is later used for internetwork connections. It is using this protocol that the path with which the data shall be transmitted is decided. There are two common IP versions which are used, To know the difference between IPv4 and IPv6, visit the linked article.
  
-	**ARP**: It stands for Address Resolution Protocol. The physical address from the IP address can be determined using ARP. 

-	**ICMP**: It stands for Internet Control Message Protocol and notification regarding datagram problems can be sent back to the user using this. Any issue with the network is immediately notified to the user by ICMP
   
### 3.	Host to Host Layer

-	This layer is parallel to the transport layer of the OSI Model
-	The error-free delivery of data is the main function of this layer
-	There are two main protocols present in this layer:
-	**TCP**: Another integral part, the Transmission Control Protocol is a reliable communication protocol. It manager the flow of data, i.e. the sequence and segmentation of the data
-	**UDP**: It is a connection-free protocol which makes it cost-effective but less reliable. 

### 4.	Application Layer

•	The topic three layers of the OSI Model: Application, Presentation and Sessions, when combined together, they perform similar functions as the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model
•	node-to-node communication based on the user-interface 

-	**HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to manage the communication between the server and web browsers
-	**NTP**: Network Time Protocol can set one standard time source in our computer, which enables sync between the server and the user
-	**TELNET**: Telecommunication Network is used to have access to files present of the Telnet network and manage them on internet
-	**FTP**: File Transfer Protocol, as the name suggests allows easy transferring of files


- Secure Shell (SSH), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet: For peer-to-peer file sharing, and, in Telnet's case, logging into another user's computer to access a file.
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): For sending and receiving email.
-	HTTP: For web access.

**Cloud Middleware:**
•	Like  Internet of Things, the cloud computing system is also a multitier architecture built on a middleware stack.

•	At the lowest machine virtualization (SSV) level, there are middleware that help reduce the overhead of virtualization. 

•	SSV is useful and widely used, but it is costly.

•	 The performance cost of virtualization, for I/O-intensive workloads in particular, can be heavy.

•	Common approaches to solve the I/O virtualization overhead focus on the I/O stack, thereby missing optimization opportunities in the overall stack. 
As an example, VAMOS(Virtualization aware middleware) , built by IBM, is a novel middleware architecture that runs its middleware modules at the hypervisor level. 
•	VAMOS reduces I/O virtualization overhead by cutting down on the overall number of guest/ hypervisor switches for I/O intensive workloads.

•	 Applying VAMOS to a database application improved its performance by up to 32 %. 

•	Here, the middleware concept is extended to include software that does interprocess communication not necessary over a network.
 
•	At the cluster computing or grid computing level, many types of work are done by middleware. 

•	The parallel computing environments such as PVM(parallel Virtual Machine) and MPI(Message Passing Interface) are (HPC)(High Performance Computing) middleware by definition; the Hadoop system and the job scheduler such as Condor, LoadLeveler, and others are all middleware.

•	 The HPC middleware fills the gap that the operating systems and the programming languages lack to support parallel computing. 

•	At the cluster computing or grid computing level, many types of work are done by middleware. 

•	The parallel computing environments such as PVM(parallel Virtual Machine) and MPI(Message Passing Interface) are (HPC)(High Performance Computing) middleware by definition; the Hadoop system and the job scheduler such as Condor, LoadLeveler, and others are all middleware.

•	 The HPC middleware fills the gap that the operating systems and the programming languages lack to support parallel computing. 

•	Many research works demonstrate a typical grid computing system and its components based on grid middleware before cloud computing.

•	 A grid computing system aims to serve all kinds of applications.

## NIST

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined a cloud computing reference architecture that includes three primary service models: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). This is commonly referred to as the SPI model. Here’s a detailed overview of each component of NIST’s SPI architecture:


![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-28 at 23 34 52_263b91cd](https://github.com/ace2884/3-2-needs/assets/119153850/5ba8c6bc-7e9d-4cd7-a473-24200c823600)


### five essential characteristics 

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**
   -  Users can automatically provision computing resources, such as server time and network storage, as needed, without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
   - **Example**: A user can create, configure, and deploy virtual machines and other resources through a web portal or API.

2. **Broad Network Access**
   -  Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
   - **Example**: Cloud services are accessible over the internet or private networks from various devices, ensuring accessibility and flexibility.

3. **Resource Pooling**
   -  The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources.
   - **Example**: Multiple users share the same physical servers, storage, and network devices, but their data and workloads are isolated from each other.

4. **Rapid Elasticity**
   - Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
   - **Example**: A business can quickly scale its IT resources up or down during peak times, such as holiday seasons, without long-term commitments.

5. **Measured Service**
   - Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.
   - **Example**: Cloud services often employ a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are billed based on their actual usage of resources.


### NIST’s SPI Architecture

#### 1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- **Definition:**
  - SaaS provides consumers the capability to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email).
- **Characteristics:**
  - **No Infrastructure Management:** Consumers do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.
  - **Subscription-Based:** Typically offered on a subscription basis with varying pricing tiers based on usage, features, or number of users.
- **Examples:**
  - Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)
  - Microsoft 365
  - Salesforce

#### 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- **Definition:**
  - PaaS provides consumers the capability to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Development and Deployment Environment:** Offers a platform including development tools, database management systems, middleware, and operating systems.
  - **No Infrastructure Management:** Consumers do not manage the underlying cloud infrastructure but have control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
- **Examples:**
  - Google App Engine
  - Microsoft Azure App Services
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk

#### 3. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- **Definition:**
  - IaaS provides consumers the capability to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Virtualized Computing Resources:** Includes virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities that can be scaled on demand.
  - **Full Control Over Infrastructure:** Consumers manage the operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
- **Examples:**
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2
  - Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
  - Google Cloud Compute Engine
 

### NIST's Deployment models

**Public Cloud**

The public cloud makes it possible for anybody to access systems and services. The public cloud may be less secure as it is open to everyone. The public cloud is one in which cloud infrastructure services are provided over the internet to the general people or major industry groups. The infrastructure in this cloud model is owned by the entity that delivers the cloud services, not by the consumer. It is a type of cloud hosting that allows customers and users to easily access systems and services. This form of cloud computing is an excellent example of cloud hosting, in which service providers supply services to a variety of customers. In this arrangement, storage backup and retrieval services are given for free, as a subscription, or on a per-user basis. For example, Google App Engine etc.

**Private Cloud**

he private cloud deployment model is the exact opposite of the public cloud deployment model. It’s a one-on-one environment for a single user (customer). There is no need to share your hardware with anyone else. The distinction between private and public clouds is in how you handle all of the hardware. It is also called the “internal cloud” & it refers to the ability to access systems and services within a given border or organization. The cloud platform is implemented in a cloud-based secure environment that is protected by powerful firewalls and under the supervision of an organization’s IT department. The private cloud gives greater flexibility of control over cloud resources.

**Hybrid Cloud**

By bridging the public and private worlds with a layer of proprietary software, hybrid cloud computing gives the best of both worlds. With a hybrid solution, you may host the app in a safe environment while taking advantage of the public cloud’s cost savings. Organizations can move data and applications between different clouds using a combination of two or more cloud deployment methods, depending on their needs. 

**Community Cloud**

It allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations. It is a distributed system that is created by integrating the services of different clouds to address the specific needs of a community, industry, or business. The infrastructure of the community could be shared between the organization which has shared concerns or tasks. It is generally managed by a third party or by the combination of one or more organizations in the community.

### Key Features and Benefits of NIST’s SPI Architecture

- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring cost efficiency and operational flexibility.
- **Accessibility:** Access services from anywhere with an internet connection, supporting remote and distributed workforces.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduce capital expenditures by transitioning to an operational expenditure model with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Maintenance:** Offload infrastructure maintenance and upgrades to the service provider, focusing internal resources on core business activities.
- **Security:** Benefit from the robust security measures implemented by cloud service providers, though shared responsibility models require consumers to manage aspects of security.

## Explain indecision service delivery in IoT

**Indecision service delivery in IoT** likely refers to a situation where services or responses are delayed due to uncertain or ambiguous conditions in the IoT environment. This can result from unreliable connectivity, inconsistent data from sensors, or inadequate processing power at the edge. It can impact the efficiency and reliability of IoT systems, requiring robust mechanisms for fault tolerance, redundancy, and decision-making algorithms to ensure timely and accurate service delivery.

##  Define Medium Access

**Medium Access** refers to the method by which multiple devices or nodes in a network contend for and access a shared communication medium, such as a wireless channel or a wired network. Medium access protocols define rules and procedures for how devices can transmit data to avoid collisions and ensure efficient use of the communication medium. Examples of medium access protocols include Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).

## Data caching in IoT.

•	 Caching Data is a process that stores multiple copies of data or files in a temporary storage location—or cache—so they can be accessed faster. 

•	It saves data for software applications, servers, and web browsers, which ensures users need not download information every time they access a website or application to speed up site loading.

•	Cached data typically includes multimedia such as images, files, and scripts, which are automatically stored on a device the first time a user opens an application or visits a website. 

•	This is used to quickly load the application or website’s information every time the user subsequently opens or visits it.

•	A Domain Name System (DNS) caches DNS records to perform faster lookups, content delivery networks (CDNs) use caching to reduce latency, and web browsers cache requested Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) files, images, and JavaScript to load websites faster.

•	 For example, when a user visits a website for the first time, an application or browser retains information to help them access it faster and more efficiently. 


### How Does Caching Work?

•	Cached data works by storing data for re-access in a device’s memory. 

•	The data is stored high up in a computer’s memory just below the central processing unit (CPU). 

•	It is stored in a few layers, with the primary cache level built into a device’s microprocessor chip, then two more secondary levels that feed the primary level.

•	 This data is stored until it's time to live (TTL), which indicates how long content needs to be cached for, expires or the device’s disk or hard drive cache fills up.

### Benefits of Caching

•	When a user visits a new website, their browser needs to download data to load and display the content on the page.

•	To speed up this process for a user's future visit, browsers cache the content on the page and save a copy of it on the device hard drive.	As a result, the next time the user goes to that website, the content is already stored on their device and the page will load faster.

•	Cache memory offers extremely low latency, which means it can be accessed quickly.  it speeds up loading the second time a user accesses an application or website.

•	Cache cannot store a lot of memory, so it only stores small files like images and web text.

•	Data can be cached in many ways, but it is typically reliant on the website’s owner to set a "header," which tells a device that data can be cached and for how long. 

•	This instructs a user’s browser what information to download and where to store the temporary files. 

•	The user can then create policies and preferences around what data they cache and even clear their whole cache to reduce the amount of data stored on their device.
