Standardization is like a double-edged sword:
  Critical to market development 
 But it may threaten innovation and inhibit change when standards are accepted by the market 
 Standardization and innovation are like yin & yang
  They could be contradictory to each other in some cases, even though this observation is debatable 
Different consortia, forums and alliances have been doing standardization in their own limited scope 
For example, 3GPP(3rd Generation Partnership Project) covers only cellular wireless networks while EPCglobal’s middleware covers only RFID events 
 Even within same segment, there are more than one consortium or forum doing standardization without enough communication with each other
  Some are even competing with each other 
 Some people believe that the IoT concept is well established 
 However, some gray zones remain in the definition, especially which technology should be included

 **Following two issues for IoT standardization in particular and ICT standardization in general may never have answers:**

 *ICT standardization is a highly decentralized activity. How can the individual activities of the network of extremely heterogeneous standards setting bodies be coordinated*

 *It will become essential to allow all interested stakeholders to participate in the standardization process toward the IoT and to voice their respective requirements and concerns. How can this be achieved?*

 ## Define Cloud Computing

 Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

### Essential Characteristics

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:**
   - Users can automatically provision computing resources, such as server time and network storage, as needed without requiring human intervention with the service provider.

2. **Broad Network Access:**
   - Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

3. **Resource Pooling:**
   - The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources.

4. **Rapid Elasticity:**
   - Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

5. **Measured Service:**
   - Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

### Service Models

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
   - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networks. They are responsible for managing the operating systems, applications, and middleware.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   - Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, usually for application development. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure, freeing developers from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
   - Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. SaaS providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, handling maintenance (e.g., software upgrades and security patching) as well.

### Deployment Models

#### Use Cases in IoT:
- **Smart Cities:** Data from various sensors (traffic, weather, pollution) can be processed and analyzed in real-time using the scalable resources of the public cloud.
- **Consumer IoT:** Applications like smart home devices and wearable technology leverage public cloud services for data storage and processing.

### 2. Private Cloud

#### Definition:
- The private cloud is a cloud deployment model where the cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization. It can be managed internally or by a third-party provider, and it can be hosted on-premises or off-premises.

#### Characteristics:
- **Enhanced Security:** Greater control over data security and privacy, suitable for sensitive applications.
- **Customization:** Infrastructure can be tailored to specific organizational needs and compliance requirements.
- **Resource Control:** Full control over the hardware and software resources.

#### Use Cases in IoT:

- **Industrial IoT:** Manufacturing plants using IoT for automation and monitoring can benefit from the security and control of private clouds.

### 3. Hybrid Cloud

#### Definition:
- The hybrid cloud is a cloud deployment model that combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model provides greater flexibility and optimized deployment based on specific needs.

#### Characteristics:
- **Flexibility:** Organizations can run sensitive workloads in private clouds and leverage public clouds for less sensitive workloads or for scaling.
- **Cost Optimization:** Balance between cost savings and resource control.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Use public clouds as backup or for disaster recovery to ensure business continuity.

#### Use Cases in IoT:
- **Smart Grids:** Energy companies can use private clouds for critical grid control systems while analyzing consumption data in the public cloud.
- **Automotive IoT:** Autonomous vehicles can process critical data on private clouds for safety and reliability, while leveraging public clouds for software updates and non-critical data analytics.

### 4. Community Cloud

#### Definition:
- The community cloud is a cloud deployment model where the cloud infrastructure is shared among several organizations with common concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It can be managed by the organizations or a third-party provider.

#### Characteristics:
- **Shared Resources:** Infrastructure is shared among organizations with similar needs, leading to cost savings.
- **Collaborative:** Facilitates collaboration and data sharing among member organizations.

   - **Components:** Web browsers, mobile apps, and desktop applications.
   - **Role of Middleware:** Middleware enables communication between client applications and backend services, often through APIs or web services.

2. **Presentation Tier:**
   - **Function:** Handles the presentation logic, formatting, and delivery of content to the client tier.
   - **Components:** Web servers, front-end frameworks (e.g., Angular, React, Vue.js).
   - **Role of Middleware:** Middleware can manage session state, user authentication, and authorization services.

3. **Application/Logic Tier:**
   - **Function:** Contains the core application logic and processes business rules and data transformations.
   - **Components:** Application servers, microservices, enterprise service buses (ESBs).
   - **Role of Middleware:** Middleware facilitates integration between various services, orchestrates business processes, and ensures reliable communication. Examples include message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) and API gateways.

4. **Data Tier:**
   - **Function:** Manages data storage and retrieval.
   - **Components:** Databases (SQL and NoSQL), data warehouses, data lakes.
