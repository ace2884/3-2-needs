## Draw the Cloud Middleware 


![image](https://github.com/ace2884/3-2-shorts/assets/119153850/01850c0a-b93a-43b9-9b74-88eaf1ae3f38)

**Cloud Middleware:**
•	Like  Internet of Things, the cloud computing system is also a multitier architecture built on a middleware stack.

•	At the lowest machine virtualization (SSV) level, there are middleware that help reduce the overhead of virtualization. 

•	SSV is useful and widely used, but it is costly.

•	 The performance cost of virtualization, for I/O-intensive workloads in particular, can be heavy.

•	Common approaches to solve the I/O virtualization overhead focus on the I/O stack, thereby missing optimization opportunities in the overall stack. 
As an example, VAMOS(Virtualization aware middleware) , built by IBM, is a novel middleware architecture that runs its middleware modules at the hypervisor level. 
•	VAMOS reduces I/O virtualization overhead by cutting down on the overall number of guest/ hypervisor switches for I/O intensive workloads.

•	 Applying VAMOS to a database application improved its performance by up to 32 %. 

•	Here, the middleware concept is extended to include software that does interprocess communication not necessary over a network.
 
•	At the cluster computing or grid computing level, many types of work are done by middleware. 

•	The parallel computing environments such as PVM(parallel Virtual Machine) and MPI(Message Passing Interface) are (HPC)(High Performance Computing) middleware by definition; the Hadoop system and the job scheduler such as Condor, LoadLeveler, and others are all middleware.

•	 The HPC middleware fills the gap that the operating systems and the programming languages lack to support parallel computing. 

•	At the cluster computing or grid computing level, many types of work are done by middleware. 

•	The parallel computing environments such as PVM(parallel Virtual Machine) and MPI(Message Passing Interface) are (HPC)(High Performance Computing) middleware by definition; the Hadoop system and the job scheduler such as Condor, LoadLeveler, and others are all middleware.

•	 The HPC middleware fills the gap that the operating systems and the programming languages lack to support parallel computing. 

•	Many research works demonstrate a typical grid computing system and its components based on grid middleware before cloud computing.

•	 A grid computing system aims to serve all kinds of applications.

 ## Define Cloud Computing

 Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

### Essential Characteristics

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:**
   - Users can automatically provision computing resources, such as server time and network storage, as needed without requiring human intervention with the service provider.

2. **Broad Network Access:**
   - Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

3. **Resource Pooling:**
   - The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources.

4. **Rapid Elasticity:**
   - Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

5. **Measured Service:**
   - Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

## Describe briefly Data caching in IoT.

### Data Caching
•	 Caching Data is a process that stores multiple copies of data or files in a temporary storage location—or cache—so they can be accessed faster. 

•	It saves data for software applications, servers, and web browsers, which ensures users need not download information every time they access a website or application to speed up site loading.

•	Cached data typically includes multimedia such as images, files, and scripts, which are automatically stored on a device the first time a user opens an application or visits a website. 

•	This is used to quickly load the application or website’s information every time the user subsequently opens or visits it.

•	A Domain Name System (DNS) caches DNS records to perform faster lookups, content delivery networks (CDNs) use caching to reduce latency, and web browsers cache requested Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) files, images, and JavaScript to load websites faster.

•	 For example, when a user visits a website for the first time, an application or browser retains information to help them access it faster and more efficiently. 


### How Does Caching Work?
•	Cached data works by storing data for re-access in a device’s memory. 

•	The data is stored high up in a computer’s memory just below the central processing unit (CPU). 

•	It is stored in a few layers, with the primary cache level built into a device’s microprocessor chip, then two more secondary levels that feed the primary level.

•	 This data is stored until it's time to live (TTL), which indicates how long content needs to be cached for, expires or the device’s disk or hard drive cache fills up.

### Benefits of Caching
•	When a user visits a new website, their browser needs to download data to load and display the content on the page.

•	To speed up this process for a user's future visit, browsers cache the content on the page and save a copy of it on the device hard drive.	As a result, the next time the user goes to that website, the content is already stored on their device and the page will load faster.

•	Cache memory offers extremely low latency, which means it can be accessed quickly.  it speeds up loading the second time a user accesses an application or website.

•	Cache cannot store a lot of memory, so it only stores small files like images and web text.

•	Data can be cached in many ways, but it is typically reliant on the website’s owner to set a "header," which tells a device that data can be cached and for how long. 

•	This instructs a user’s browser what information to download and where to store the temporary files. 

•	The user can then create policies and preferences around what data they cache and even clear their whole cache to reduce the amount of data stored on their device.


## Describe the procedure to implement smart parking using IoT.

### Smart Parking
•	An IoT-based parking system is a centralized management that enables drivers to search for and reserve a parking spot remotely through their smartphones. 

•	It offers a convenient arrangement for drivers to park their cars when they are looking to avoid potential traffic congestion.

•	The system’s hardware sensors detect available slots and communicate the information to the drivers in that area in real-time.

•	IoT technology ensures that they do not have to worry about finding an available space again – allowing them to travel conveniently. 

•	the connected device sends alerts about peak times and surcharges.

•	No one wants to struggle to find a parking slot or pay more at any given point.

•	Using smart parking technology will help maximize the consumption of existing parking space, increase the effectiveness of parking operations, and facilitate easier traffic flow with just a few taps on a mobile app.

•	Smart parking solutions are intended to give drivers complete control of their journey - from start to finish - without having to hunt for parking. 

•	The IoT technology helps save costs and minimize travel time.

•	 IoT forms the foundation for real-time data collection and analysis.

### The IoT-Based Smart Farming Cycle
•	     IoT devices installed on a farm should collect and process data in a repetitive cycle that enables farmers to react quickly to emerging issues and changes in ambient conditions. Smart farming follows a cycle similar to this one:
•**Observation** . Sensors record observational data from the crops, livestock, soil, or atmosphere. 

• **Diagnostics.** The sensor values are fed to a cloud-hosted IoT platform with predefined decision rules and models—also called “business logic”—that ascertain the condition of the examined object and identify any deficiencies or needs.

•**Decisions** . After issues are revealed, the user, and/or machine learning-driven components of the IoT platform determine whether location-specific treatment is necessary and, if so, which.

•**Action** . After end-user evaluation and action, the cycle repeats from the beginning.
