 ## Define Cloud Computing

 Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

### Essential Characteristics

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:**
   - Users can automatically provision computing resources, such as server time and network storage, as needed without requiring human intervention with the service provider.

2. **Broad Network Access:**
   - Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

3. **Resource Pooling:**
   - The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources.

4. **Rapid Elasticity:**
   - Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

5. **Measured Service:**
   - Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

### Service Models

## Describe briefly Data caching in IoT.

### Data Caching
•	 Caching Data is a process that stores multiple copies of data or files in a temporary storage location—or cache—so they can be accessed faster. 

•	It saves data for software applications, servers, and web browsers, which ensures users need not download information every time they access a website or application to speed up site loading.

•	Cached data typically includes multimedia such as images, files, and scripts, which are automatically stored on a device the first time a user opens an application or visits a website. 

•	This is used to quickly load the application or website’s information every time the user subsequently opens or visits it.

•	A Domain Name System (DNS) caches DNS records to perform faster lookups, content delivery networks (CDNs) use caching to reduce latency, and web browsers cache requested Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) files, images, and JavaScript to load websites faster.

•	 For example, when a user visits a website for the first time, an application or browser retains information to help them access it faster and more efficiently. 


### How Does Caching Work?
•	Cached data works by storing data for re-access in a device’s memory. 

•	The data is stored high up in a computer’s memory just below the central processing unit (CPU). 

•	It is stored in a few layers, with the primary cache level built into a device’s microprocessor chip, then two more secondary levels that feed the primary level.

•	 This data is stored until it's time to live (TTL), which indicates how long content needs to be cached for, expires or the device’s disk or hard drive cache fills up. 

![image](https://github.com/ace2884/3-2-shorts/assets/119153850/ed044745-3432-4c0e-8d76-a88b2d0a9a5e)


### Benefits of Caching
•	When a user visits a new website, their browser needs to download data to load and display the content on the page.

•	To speed up this process for a user's future visit, browsers cache the content on the page and save a copy of it on the device hard drive.	As a result, the next time the user goes to that website, the content is already stored on their device and the page will load faster.

•	Cache memory offers extremely low latency, which means it can be accessed quickly.  it speeds up loading the second time a user accesses an application or website.

•	Cache cannot store a lot of memory, so it only stores small files like images and web text.

•	Data can be cached in many ways, but it is typically reliant on the website’s owner to set a "header," which tells a device that data can be cached and for how long. 

•	This instructs a user’s browser what information to download and where to store the temporary files. 

•	The user can then create policies and preferences around what data they cache and even clear their whole cache to reduce the amount of data stored on their device.
